# Node.js Web Page with SQL Template

This Node.js template provides a foundation for developing web applications with pre-installed SQL query handling using the [js-SQLquerymaker-Tmpl8](https://github.com/comus3/js-SQLquerymaker-Tmpl8) library. It simplifies the process of interacting with SQL databases in your Node.js application.

## SQL Query Handling

The SQL query handling functionality is implemented using the [js-SQLquerymaker-Tmpl8](https://github.com/comus3/js-SQLquerymaker-Tmpl8) library. Refer to the documentation in the provided link for details on how to use this library to construct SQL queries efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start writing your HTML in the `home.ejs` file located in the `views` folder.

## Running the Server

To start your server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start the server, and you can access your application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
